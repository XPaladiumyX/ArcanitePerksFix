This Minecraft plugin allows you to set on any custom model data of an armor a perk
Features:
- Can set any given effects on equip of a custom armor
- Can set a message and equip/unequip
I let this plugin as OpenSource in case if someone need the patern
This plugin is not going to be maintained for other server owners/devlopper
We made this plugin for the Minecraft Server Sky X Network to fight against ItemsAdder plugin perks
function who's not that good. By remaking this plugin we are able to do what we want with the perks

# This plugin supports Minecraft Spigot 1.20-1.20.1
